            Our mind can be a constant chatter-box.
            Thoughts can pile up at times appearing rapidly
            and unfolding like an unstoppable sequence.
            It can feel overwhelming... Have you ever wondered if you can take control
            and be in charge of your own mental state?

       At first it sounds like a lot of work 
       or even impossible, but it is actually 
       not that far-fetched. 
       A simple exercise, done consistently can help you do just that.
       It's a technique that works better each time you practice it.
     </div>
     <span id="b3" class="dot">◦</span>
     <div id="text3" class="container">
       The objective is to try and clear your mind and
       then ask yourself: <strong> "What is my next thought?"</strong>
     </div>
     <span id="b4" class="dot">◦</span>
     <div id="text4" class="container">
              You will notice that the next thought will 
              appear with a certain delay. It is no longer 
              self driven. It has become an employee of your 
              awareness.      
       Once identified, simply push it out of your 
       mind frame by actually visualizing this gesture.

       The Mind Tame Web App is merely a small psychological helping tool
       to get you started. By trying out the technique physically,
       you can get an idea of how to construct your own
       mental representations of the process.

       Sometimes thoughts can pile up so fast
       you feel it's to hard to focus. 
       Don't run away from your thoughts.
       Instead keep inviting them into your awareness
       by <strong>asking for the next thought.</strong>

       The effects of this practice are generally feelings of
       well being and relief. Whether it's a tension in your mind
       or a general mental pressure you feel as unbearing, or even 
       a bothering headache, start lining up your thoughts and simply 
       push them out of your system.
